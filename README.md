# Polynomial Derivative and Integral Calculator

## Details

## Description

This little application will calculate derivatives and integrals of decimal number polynomial functions according to the power rule. The application uses JOptionPane dialogs for input/output.

The application accepts some implicit and unsimplified forms of polynomials. For instance, if you tell it to calculate the derivative of:

```
3x + 5.35x^2 + 2 + 5x
```

It will give you:

```
10.7x + 8
```

## Why

There are plenty of superior online resources for computing derivatives and integrals. The reason why I wanted to make this script was to better understand how to apply the power rule. However, the vast majority of time spent making this ended up going into converting String to Polynomial and vice versa (The Polynomial constructor and toString method).
